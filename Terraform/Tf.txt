1. Welcome and Introduction (5 mins)

Brief overview of the session goals.

Importance of Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Quick intro to Terraform as a leading IaC tool.


2. What is Terraform? (10 mins)

Definition and purpose.

Advantages over manual provisioning.

Comparison with other IaC tools (like CloudFormation, Ansible).

Use cases: multi-cloud infrastructure, automation, and scaling.


3. Terraform Architecture (10 mins)

Providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).

State files and their importance.

Execution flow: Init → Plan → Apply → Destroy.

Configuration files (.tf).


4. Terraform Installation and Setup (10 mins)

Prerequisites: CLI, Terraform binary.

Installation demo or guide (OS-specific).

Setting up the workspace (folder structure).


5. Writing Your First Terraform Code (20 mins)

Structure of a .tf file:

Provider block.

Resource block.

Variables and Outputs.


Example: Provision an AWS EC2 instance or Azure Virtual Machine.

Execution:

terraform init

terraform plan

terraform apply

terraform destroy



6. Managing State Files (15 mins)

Importance of state files (terraform.tfstate).

Remote state storage options (e.g., S3, Azure Blob).

Handling state locks.


7. Key Features of Terraform (15 mins)

Modularization:

Creating reusable modules.

Module registry.


Dependency Management:

depends_on example.


Lifecycle rules (create_before_destroy, ignore_changes).

Workspaces for multi-environment deployments.


8. Debugging and Error Handling (10 mins)

Common errors and resolutions.

Using terraform validate and terraform fmt.


9. Best Practices (10 mins)

Maintain a Git repository for Terraform code.

Use .gitignore for sensitive files like .tfstate.

Locking provider versions.

Collaboration with Terraform Cloud/Enterprise.


10. Q&A and Wrap-Up (10 mins)

Address questions from participants.

Share learning resources: HashiCorp documentation, tutorials, GitHub repositories.

Provide a sample project for hands-on practice.
